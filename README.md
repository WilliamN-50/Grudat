# Domain Coloring Package

### Package for visualizing complex functions on the complex plane

Domain coloring is a method to easily visualize complex functions by mapping each output of a complex-valued function to a color.

|Figure 1: Domain coloring of the function f(z) = z<sup>3</sup>-1. 
The three roots of the function is clearly visible as three black dots.|

The branch cut on the left side of the graph can be seen as a sharp transition of colors.|

### Documentation

There is more information about the package at [documentation.md](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/grudat21/wnguyen-ovn7/blob/master/Documentation.md).

### Roadmap

- The API of this library is frozen.
- Version number adhere to semantic versioning.

The only accepted reason to modify the API is to handle issues that are not possible to solve in other reasonably ways.
